         <strong><u>Menstrual Cycle</u></strong>
       </p align="center">
     </div id= "title">
     The Menstrual cycle is a monthly bleeding that occurs when a woman's body sheds the lining of her uterus. Menstruation begins during puberty and ends at menopause.
     <pre>
     </pre>
     <div class="row">
       <div class="column" style="background-color:#faebeb;">
         <p><center>Each of the 73 million menstruating women in North America will throw away approximately 16,800 disposable pads or tampons in her lifetime; that's 125-150 kg of waste  </center></p>
       </div>
       <div class="column" style="background-color:#faebeb;">
         <p><center>During her lifetime, a woman will menstruate an average of 3000 days and will lose 2-3 tablespoons of blood each period </center></p>
       </div>
       <div class="column" style="background-color:#faebeb;">
         <p><center>In Africa, one in ten adolescent girls miss school during their period  </center></p>

     <pre>
     </pre>
     <p> At A Woman's Web we look to raise awareness at common period problems, including the cost and expense of living for women. In California, period products are estimated to create a revenue of over $20 million annually, just from taxes! In India, the lack of sanitary products causes 23% of teenage girls to drop out of school. We work to creating an affordable lifestyle for females across the globe!

        <p>
          Depression is almost twice as likely to affect women than men and can lead to different illnesses and causes. Most of this is because of biological, hormonal, psychological, and social causes.

        <h4>Postpartum Depression</h4>
        <p>
